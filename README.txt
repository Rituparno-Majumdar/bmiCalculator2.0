BMI Calculator
Welcome to the BMI Calculator! This is a simple Python program that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on user input for height and weight. It also provides additional messages based on the calculated BMI to give insights into the weight category.

Getting Started
To use the BMI Calculator program, follow these steps:

1.Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

Prerequisites

Python 3.x

Usage

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where the code file is located.
3. Run the following command to execute the program: python bmiCalculator2.0.py
4. Enter your height in meters when prompted.
5. Enter your weight in kilograms when prompted.
6. The program will calculate your BMI and display the result, along with an additional message based on the BMI category.

Example

Enter your height in m: 1.75
Enter your weight in kg: 65

Your BMI according to your height and weight is 21.22
You are in the normal weight category.

Please note that the BMI value is an indicator of body fatness and is used to screen for weight categories that may lead to health problems. The program provides messages such as "Clinically Obese," "Obese," "Overweight," "Normal Weight," or "Underweight" based on the calculated BMI.

Feel free to modify the code to suit your needs or incorporate it into your own projects.
